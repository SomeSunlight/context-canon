# Topics

A Topic answers a practical question:

> When this kind of work is being done, what additional context should be read?

`CONTEXT.md` should stay small. It contains the rules that are broadly relevant and a concise list of Topics. Each Topic describes when it matters and points to the deeper information needed for that work.

## Required and optional information

A Topic contains two kinds of references:

- **Required** — must be read when the Topic applies.
- **Optional** — useful for deeper understanding, troubleshooting, history, or unusual cases.

Example:

```markdown
### Logging

When changing logging, diagnostics, structured events, rotation, or troubleshooting:

Required:
- `docs/logging-contract.md`

Optional:
- `docs/logging-history.md`
- `docs/troubleshooting.md`
```

The distinction is important. A model should not have to guess whether a linked document is mandatory, and it should not load every optional document merely because it exists.

## Progressive disclosure can repeat

A required document should again put the most important information first. It may then point to more detailed material.

The result resembles a well-designed website: the first page gives orientation, important next steps are explicit, and deeper information remains one link away instead of being placed on the first page.

## Topics are also context integration

At first, a Topic may simply connect a task with a Markdown document. The mechanism is more general than that.

A Topic is a structured way to integrate additional information into the working context when it becomes relevant. Over time this may include:

- architecture and design documents,
- glossaries and domain terminology,
- coding patterns and example code,
- CSV files, schemas, tables, and other structured data,
- PDFs, images, and diagrams,
- skills and executable workflows,
- test fixtures and examples,
- operational experience, known pitfalls, and troubleshooting knowledge.

This is one of ContextCanon's larger opportunities: the same transparent mechanism can bring many kinds of project knowledge into an agent's context without making all of it permanently resident in the prompt.

## Source location and published location

Authors should keep information where it naturally belongs. A security document may remain `SECURITY.md`; architecture documentation may remain under `docs/`; a glossary may live beside the domain model.

When ContextCanon builds an Official Context Package, referenced material that must travel with the node is materialized under `CONTEXT/`. The generated `CONTEXT.md` links to those package-local copies.

This gives authors a natural repository layout while giving consumers a self-contained published package.

## What decides that a Topic applies?

The compiler preserves Topic definitions deterministically. A harness or agent may decide that a natural-language task matches a Topic, because that decision can require semantic interpretation.

Once a Topic applies, however, Required versus Optional is explicit. The harness should not invent its own meaning for those references.
