# ContextCanon Foundation — Official Context

**Node:** ContextCanon Foundation  
**Context version:** `0.1.0-draft`

## How to use this context

Apply all Rules below to every task in this Node.

For the current task, evaluate each Topic condition. When one matches, read every **Required** target before continuing; read **Optional** targets only when useful.

## Rules

### Canonical context

#### `CC-001` — One official package

The compiled Official Context Package is the single canonical context for a Node: it applies to the Node itself and is the package meaning published to child Nodes.

#### `CC-002` — Edit source, not generated output

Human context changes are authored in `CONTEXT.src.md`; generated context views, package contents, machine state, and harness adapters are not edited directly.

### Machine state

#### `CC-003` — Keep compiler bookkeeping out of the normal workflow

Framework bookkeeping belongs under `.context/` and should not be required reading for normal human or agent work.

### Composition

#### `CC-004` — No implicit Source precedence

Context Sources are composed without implicit precedence; conflicts are resolved explicitly through local changes rather than Source order.

### Identity

#### `CC-005` — Stable identity

Every addressable context element has a stable ID independent of its title, wording, file location, and presentation.

#### `CC-006` — Publish IDs that children may reference

Published official contexts expose stable IDs for Rules and other elements that child Nodes may reference.

### Progressive disclosure

#### `CC-007` — Keep entry context small

Keep the official entry context compact and use Topics to load deeper context only when needed; Topic targets distinguish Required from Optional material.

### Project state

#### `CC-008` — State stays local

`STATE.md` describes the current local project situation and is never inherited as governance by child Nodes.

### Harness independence

#### `CC-009` — Canonical context is model- and harness-neutral

Project code and canonical project context must not depend on a particular LLM or agent harness; harness-specific files are thin generated adapters at the edge.

### Repository conventions

#### `CC-010` — Keep familiar repository documents useful

Keep `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` present when they are useful to the repository even when ContextCanon is present.

### Documentation style

#### `CC-011` — Write for intelligent readers

Write technical documentation in precise, plain prose for intelligent readers; introduce unfamiliar concepts before using specialized terms and avoid unexplained internal shorthand, inflated marketing language, and unnecessary jargon.
