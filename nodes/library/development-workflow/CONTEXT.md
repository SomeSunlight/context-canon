**Node:** Development Workflow  
**Context version:** `0.2.0-draft`

## Overview

Reusable workflow for carrying project development safely across long human/LLM-assisted sessions, tool failures, review rounds, and merges. It standardizes recoverable planning and review boundaries without prescribing a particular programming language, CI system, operating system, or ContextCanon baseline.

This Node deliberately does **not** compose ContextCanon Foundation. A consumer may compose Foundation and this workflow independently when both are useful; using the workflow alone must not pull unrelated framework governance transitively.

## How to use this context

Apply all Rules below to every task in this Node.

For the current task, evaluate each Topic condition. When one matches, read every **Required** target before continuing; read **Optional** targets only when useful.

## Rules

### Recoverable planning

#### `CCW-001` — Plan a coherent change block before editing

Before starting a new coherent development block, record a short purpose and checklist in the project's durable planning surface; use `PLAN.md` when the project follows this workflow convention.

#### `CCW-002` — Checkpoint completed plan items immediately

When a listed step is actually complete, mark its `PLAN.md` checkbox `[x]` immediately rather than reconstructing completion at the end of a long session.

#### `CCW-003` — Keep recovery-critical knowledge in the repository

Put decisions, active constraints, accepted state, and next steps needed to resume work in repository documentation such as `PLAN.md`, `STATE.md`, or the project's equivalent rather than relying on chat history or model memory.

#### `CCW-007` — Resume recent explicit continuation without re-proving unchanged state

When the project owner resumes work after a short conversational interruption, explicitly says to continue, and reports no intervening repository changes, continue from the last established branch/PR state unless a repository operation gives evidence that it changed. Do not spend a new work cycle re-checking already established repository facts merely to prove that nothing happened.

### Proportional verification

#### `CCW-004` — Batch related edits before expensive final verification

For one coherent correction block, make the related authoring/code changes and run proportionate focused checks first; do not repeat the project's most expensive generated-output, integration, packaging, or full verification cycle after every micro-edit.

#### `CCW-005` — Require exact-head green verification at the merge gate, not the first review gate

A coherent development block may be presented for project-owner review while understood and disclosed CI failures or generated drift remain. After explicit project-owner approval and before merging, require the exact current head to pass the project's complete merge-gate verification, including zero generated drift when generated canonical output is part of the project contract.

### Human review gate

#### `CCW-006` — Do not merge without explicit project-owner approval

Keep a review PR or equivalent change set open until the project owner explicitly approves the reviewed result.

### Accepted baseline

#### `CCW-008` — Close the post-merge baseline checkpoint before new development

After a reviewed change is successfully merged into the accepted branch, reconcile the durable repository state that records the accepted baseline before starting the next coherent development block. Record the merge outcome in `PLAN.md`, update `STATE.md` or equivalent current-state documentation, and refresh README/CHANGELOG or review-status wording made stale by the merge when applicable.

### Executing a development block
